//VIEConcept the imported data is on the name which imported it. like 'tourController' in our case. So to access the data it holds, we have to use "itsname.exportedfunctionORvalues". eg. router.get(tourController.getAllTours). But if you dont want to use this method, look into userRoutes.js method where i have wrote a way to use the names of the exported properties only like old time.
