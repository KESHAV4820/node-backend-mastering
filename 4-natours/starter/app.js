/*NoteVIE Express
üëâExpress is minimum node.js liberary.
üëâWhy are we using "Postman" software for API making and testing. Becouse it has a lot of feature that let's us do much more robust API testing, formation, and industry ready settings testing. 
üëâExpress has a lot of methods on "request" and "response", much much more than Node.js; that's why we use Express third party API, not node.js.
üëâ in express, if we don't specify the status code, by default it takes code 200 meaning OK in postman. 200 is default. 
-------------REST API------------------
üëâAPI: Application Program Interface. It's a part of software that can be used by another software to allow interaction between them. 
üëâReST means "Representational State Transfer". It's the architecture name which shows how and API has been built. Using which architecture. ReST being one of the kind.Properties that ReSTful API must have:-
    ‚úÖ Separation of API into logical Resources
        üëâResources:- are Objects or representation of something which has data associated with it. For example: users, reviews etc.Basically, any information that can be named is a resouces.
    ‚úÖ Expose structured, resource-based URLs
        üëâExpose Structure:- is the part of that code which has been made available to users to interect with the underlying "Resources". Eg. https://www.natours.com/addNewTour
                               [___üëÜ____] Endpoint
        [___________üëÜ________________]URL
        There are many endpoints that you can can use like /getTour or /updateTour or /deleteTour or /getTourByUsers or /deleteTourByUsers            
    ‚úÖ use HTTP methods to add, delete or communicate. Concept Basically CRUD operation. Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
        üëâ Do note that above endpoints aren't correct. We should only use HTTP methods to perform any function on data. Hence endpoints should only contain the resources not the actions that we can perform on the data. Becouse it will become unmanagable in no time. Hence the above endpoints should be named like /tours or /tourByUser or /tourByUser/userid=blahblah. So in this manner, we have only the resource name( in plural sense), not the verbs like get, update, post, delete becouse these verbs are http methods.
        üëâGET:- used to perform read operation on data. GET tours/7
        üëâPOST:- used to perform create operation on data or add new content to the server.It creaes a new Resource. Note in these case, no userid is sent as it is getting created for first time and server decides what's the new id is going to be according to it's programming. eg. POST/Tours
            Note: id you see the beauty that we are using the same resource name, but with different verbs(http methods). And it's working fine. We aren't using /getTour, becouse that will become unmanagable. 
        üëâPUT:- used to perform full update operation on data. PUT tours/7
        üëâPATCH:- used to perform partial update operation on data. PATCH tours/7. A better choice amongst PUT and PATCH.
        üëâDELETE:- used to perform delete operation on data. DELETE tours/7
        üëâ we can also create no CRUD operations as well like /login or /search.
    These are  for CLIENTS TO CONSUME.

    ‚úÖsending and receiving data between client and API should be done only in the standardised formate of JSON formate. Clients receive data or send data, servers send data or receive data should be done in JSON formate only.
        ‚òë in JSON, all the keys in key-value pair has to be string only. keys meaning the name of the parameters of the object written in JSON.
        ‚òë New Element: but before sending the JSON, we do "Response Formating" by using JSend. in this, we introduce two keys. 
        "status": success or failure. And another is 'data':{write the original data here.}. Even more formating can be added. But this is the simplest one. Simple is best. 
        ‚òëNew Element: wrapping the data into additional object is called as "envalpoing". 
    ‚úÖthe API should be stateless.
        ‚òëMeaning of stateless:- all the state is handled on the client and not the server. "State" simply means as piece of data in application that might change over time as the application progressess. Like user is logged in or logged out. "each request must be handled at client" simply means that each response from client must have all the data needed to process a request on the server.
        ‚òëThat is SERVER MUST NEVER REMEMBER THE LAST REQUEST TO PROCESS THE CURRENT REQUEST. atleast in ReSTful API, we avoid it.  
üëâ Note that every time you save somthing into json file, it reloads the whole server and page. So even if the code is outside the server section, it will be reloaded. Hence don't feel confused that how did it happened. It's a feature of json file handling in node.
üëâ TRICKüòéüòé in JS : if you want to conver a number into string you need to concate ""empty space with it. Like 5+"" where + is concate operator. Similarly, if you have to convert a string into number you need to multiply it with some number. Eg. "5" * 1 will give a number type 5üòä

//----------Middle ware--------------
1Ô∏è‚É£ A middleware is something like a function that lies between the "initial request" made by a user when comming to server and the final response that has to be returned finally. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úî You need to imagine it like a pipe or pipeline. 
    It has start and end and length is divided into many section accroding to middleware stack, that is arrangement of middleware function in code.
    ‚úî the order of arrangement of middleware stack has different effect each time. And hence, it is called as middleware stack.
    ‚úî each middleware function has access to "next" function. And it is called generally at last so as to move the process to next middleware in the stack. It's important or the process will hang. 
    ‚úî all the middleware are basically functions that are in between and process the request and response. IN that sense, express and it's function, all of them, All, are middleware functions only.  
3Ô∏è‚É£in each middleware function, we have access to the "(request, response, next)=>{}" parameters like it were passing from initial request stage on server to final response stage from server like it were passing from a tube or pipe.Remember It üëâNever forget to call next() function in a middleware. If you miss it, the request and response cycle would get jammed to one place. 
4Ô∏è‚É£Middleware applies to each and every request. Why, becouse it owns a cross-section of pipeline. So you have to pass through their area(that is code in the middleware codestack) and it's not always the case but if we want to avoid one section, we need to make a branching in the pipe and using routing, we can decide if request has to reach a particular middleware or not. If we don't specify routing, by default, it is thought that the pipeline is made of a a single non-branching pipe. Hence, each of the section will have an access to the function parameters.
5Ô∏è‚É£Conceptif the "route-handler" comes before the middleware, it may not be possible that all the middlewares will get access to request and response. becouse it is possible that router-handler may call a middleware that ends the request, response cycle before another middleware that may want it. But if the "route-handler" comes after the middlewares, each middleware that came before the route-handler will have access to request and response parameters of server. 
6Ô∏è‚É£ Point number 5üëÜ is fundamental to the working of Express. Remember it. 
7Ô∏è‚É£ we can download third party middlewares from NPM like "morgan". It is a third party loging(console.log()) middleware. It lets you see he requests made in your console. 
8Ô∏è‚É£in order to implement separate file segement for each resource for better code structure, we will need to create router for each resources, that is, small subapp for each router.
9Ô∏è‚É£Concept we created different routers for different resources for having separation of concern between these resources.Basically, we created one small app or sub app for each of them(like tourRoutes.js or userRoutes.js) and putting them together in one main app file called app.js
üîüSub-routers has to be middleware or else show will you mount them onto bigger app router referance.
1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating "server.js file" but why!! üò® becouse it's considered a good practise to keep all the things related to express in one file and every thing related to server in one file. It is also the file where we have other data as well like database configuration or environment variable or some error handling stuff. All of these live in server.js which is our entery point 
1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£server.js will actually be our starter file where every thing for backend starts and it's here we listen to our server.
1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£app.use(express.static(`${__dirname}/public`));//Without this LOC you won't be able to access static contents of the project.And also note that IT WORK FOR ONLY THE STATIC FILES VIENote After using the express.static() middleware, you need to pass only üëâüò®127.0.0.1:3000/overview.html even though the real path of the file isü•¥ 127.0.0.1:3000/public/overview.html. Becouse when a file is asked for, it looks around and if it can't find it there, it goes to public folder to find the same file. Hence if a file is already in the public folder, it will be found if it has been asked.And after this, it sets the root folder as the public folder, that is 127.0.0.1:3000 becomes the root folder for time being.
----------Environments for Node---------
1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ There are different environment settings in which Node.js development works. There are Production environment(default by Express), debugging environment, development environment and each environment has it's own usecase just like having fair copy and a rough copy while doing mathematics. in Development, you may want to develop along the lines of one testing database, but in production, it will have another database, loging in turned on/off.
1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£Every thing not related to express.js shall be done outside the app.js file. ü•¥which is this file, app.js. We use app.js to only configure our express application.Environement variables are out of the scope of express variables.

It's just a step that request goes through, and the data from body is added to request object.It is used to add a middleware function in middleware. YOu can consider it as pipeline. But there are various sections of this pipeline and you are adding those sections by using app.use() function and the parameter used like express.json() or any other function adds the specified function like a section to this pipeline.
