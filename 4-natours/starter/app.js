/*NoteVIE Express
ðŸ‘‰Express is minimum node.js liberary.
ðŸ‘‰Why are we using "Postman" software for API making and testing. Becouse it has a lot of feature that let's us do much more robust API testing, formation, and industry ready settings testing. 
ðŸ‘‰Express has a lot of methods on "request" and "response", much much more than Node.js; that's why we use Express third party API, not node.js.
ðŸ‘‰ in express, if we don't specify the status code, by default it takes code 200 meaning OK in postman. 200 is default. 
-------------REST API------------------
ðŸ‘‰API: Application Program Interface. It's a part of software that can be used by another software to allow interaction between them. 
ðŸ‘‰ReST means "Representational State Transfer". It's the architecture name which shows how and API has been built. Using which architecture. ReST being one of the kind.Properties that ReSTful API must have:-
    âœ… Separation of API into logical Resources
        ðŸ‘‰Resources:- are Objects or representation of something which has data associated with it. For example: users, reviews etc.Basically, any information that can be named is a resouces.
    âœ… Expose structured, resource-based URLs
        ðŸ‘‰Expose Structure:- is the part of that code which has been made available to users to interect with the underlying "Resources". Eg. https://www.natours.com/addNewTour
                               [___ðŸ‘†____] Endpoint
        [___________ðŸ‘†________________]URL
        There are many endpoints that you can can use like /getTour or /updateTour or /deleteTour or /getTourByUsers or /deleteTourByUsers            
    âœ… use HTTP methods to add, delete or communicate. Concept Basically CRUD operation. Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
        ðŸ‘‰ Do note that above endpoints aren't correct. We should only use HTTP methods to perform any function on data. Hence endpoints should only contain the resources not the actions that we can perform on the data. Becouse it will become unmanagable in no time. Hence the above endpoints should be named like /tours or /tourByUser or /tourByUser/userid=blahblah. So in this manner, we have only the resource name( in plural sense), not the verbs like get, update, post, delete becouse these verbs are http methods.
        ðŸ‘‰GET:- used to perform read operation on data. GET tours/7
        ðŸ‘‰POST:- used to perform create operation on data or add new content to the server.It creaes a new Resource. Note in these case, no userid is sent as it is getting created for first time and server decides what's the new id is going to be according to it's programming. eg. POST/Tours
            Note: id you see the beauty that we are using the same resource name, but with different verbs(http methods). And it's working fine. We aren't using /getTour, becouse that will become unmanagable. 
        ðŸ‘‰PUT:- used to perform full update operation on data. PUT tours/7
        ðŸ‘‰PATCH:- used to perform partial update operation on data. PATCH tours/7. A better choice amongst PUT and PATCH.
        ðŸ‘‰DELETE:- used to perform delete operation on data. DELETE tours/7
        ðŸ‘‰ we can also create no CRUD operations as well like /login or /search.
    These are  for CLIENTS TO CONSUME.

    âœ…sending and receiving data between client and API should be done only in the standardised formate of JSON formate. Clients receive data or send data, servers send data or receive data should be done in JSON formate only.
        â˜‘ in JSON, all the keys in key-value pair has to be string only. keys meaning the name of the parameters of the object written in JSON.
        â˜‘ New Element: but before sending the JSON, we do "Response Formating" by using JSend. in this, we introduce two keys. 
        "status": success or failure. And another is 'data':{write the original data here.}. Even more formating can be added. But this is the simplest one. Simple is best. 
        â˜‘New Element: wrapping the data into additional object is called as "envalpoing". 
    âœ…the API should be stateless.
        â˜‘Meaning of stateless:- all the state is handled on the client and not the server. "State" simply means as piece of data in application that might change over time as the application progressess. Like user is logged in or logged out. "each request must be handled at client" simply means that each response from client must have all the data needed to process a request on the server.
        â˜‘That is SERVER MUST NEVER REMEMBER THE LAST REQUEST TO PROCESS THE CURRENT REQUEST. atleast in ReSTful API, we avoid it.  
ðŸ‘‰ Note that every time you save somthing into json file, it reloads the whole server and page. So even if the code is outside the server section, it will be reloaded. Hence don't feel confused that how did it happened. It's a feature of json file handling in node.
ðŸ‘‰ TRICKðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž in JS : if you want to conver a number into string you need to concate ""empty space with it. Like 5+"" where + is concate operator. Similarly, if you have to convert a string into number you need to multiply it with some number. Eg. "5" * 1 will give a number type 5ðŸ˜Š

const app=express();// here express will add many of it's method to app variable.
app.use(express.json());// here ""app.use()" is as middleware". It's called middleware. Why! Becouse it stands between "request" and "response". It's just a step that request goes through, and the data from body is added to request object.

/*
app.get('/', (request, response)=>{ 
    // response.status(200).send('Hello World from SERVER SideðŸ˜Ž');Alternative CodeðŸ‘‡ since send() simply sends the string to client.Note If you want to send the object, you need to use json().

app.post('/api/v1/tours', createTour);//New Element Concept:  all the data being sent by the client to the server is stored in the variable "request". But by default, EXPRESS won't do it, that it, it won't write data on the request variable. Hence to do that, we need a "MIDDLE WARE".
