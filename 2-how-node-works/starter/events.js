/*Note: 
ðŸ”µAS you can understand that LOC 8 is importing the events class. LOC10 is creating an object of the class. LOC14, LOC18 is setting the emitter to listen to the event. LOC24, LOC25 is firing the event.
ðŸ”µOBSERVER PATTERN: as you can see that the code in LOC 14,18 are OBSERVING the activity of the LOC in 24,25. That's why it is called so. It's like passive listening or passive radar guidance system. ðŸ˜Š
 ðŸ”µserver emits. But using .on() method on server like "server.on()"âž¡ this whole thing becomes like an eventListeners.
 The emitter is the one that emits the event. The listener is the one that listens to the event.
 ðŸ”µemitters can also take some parameters and so does it's listeners which is server.on() and this parameter is used to pass some more parameter for diverse implementation and listening shake. LOC 19 and LOC 26. 
 ðŸ”µsince there are multiple listeners on same emitter and you want order into their execution, you will use "syn" codes which are blocking code in nature but they will enforce order. This is an apt example that Concept no code is bad. They exist becouse they have purpose. Use them according to their purpose or every piece of code is flawed for you. 
 ðŸ”µ WE don't need to 'emit' the event on our own. It is done automatically for in-built components. But when we make our own custom events, then in those cases, we will need to make our own "emitter" as well. custom emiter to notify the actions for custom events.
